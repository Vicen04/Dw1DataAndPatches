# Dw1DataAndPatches
A repository to add some info about the code from Digimon World 1 that I have not seen anywhere yet and some patches to fix some errors from the game.
This was possible thanks to SydMontage repository providing information to be able to find/discover the location of the code. 
This is being done during my free time and I may or may not update it further.

Some emulators may need to regenerate the EDC/ECC in the bin before being able to play.

Document with a easier to read "movement allowed" list: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vHHa8ynxtnFuwiQst09I0L4jDMKb8ZLdyxXYkoMi_UA/edit?usp=sharing

Check the wiki for more detailed information: 

Update: All of the patches that fix/improve code from the original game that are included in either my hack or Maeson's hack have been uploaded. The only part left is the code that adds/expands stuff. Which is going to be divided in two parts:

1. Add an extra playable digimon
2. Evolution an other miscellaneous changes

Once this is done. I'll upload my hack here too.
