# Dw1DataAndPatches
A repository to add some info about the code from Digimon World 1 that I have not seen anywhere yet and some patches to fix some errors from the game.
This was possible thanks to SydMontage repository providing information to be able to find/discover the location of the code. 
This is being done during my free time and I may or may not update it further.
