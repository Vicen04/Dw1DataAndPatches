# Dw1DataAndPatches
A repository to add some info about the code from Digimon World 1 that I have not seen anywhere yet and some patches to fix some errors from the game, it also includes a hack made thanks to these changes.

This was possible thanks to SydMontague repository providing information to be able to find/discover the location of the code. Also I want to give credit to Romsstar which did a lot of work and helped a lot to various people to obtain data from Digimon World.

I have created a hack which mostly includes the changes shown in this repository (Last update 15/09/24).

This is being done during my free time; the hack has been finished, more updates may come in the future. I'm not sure if I'll upload more of the original code.
