# Dw1DataAndPatches
A repository to add some info about the code from Digimon World 1 that I have not seen anywhere yet and some patches to fix some errors from the game.

This was possible thanks to SydMontage repository providing information to be able to find/discover the location of the code.

Some emulators may need to regenerate the EDC/ECC in the bin before being able to play.

This is being done during my free time, the hack has been finished, I'm not sure if I'll upload more of the original code.
