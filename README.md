# Dw1DataAndPatches
A repository to add some info about the code from Digimon World 1 that I have not seen anywhere yet and some patches to fix some errors from the game, it also includes a hack made thanks to these changes.

This was possible thanks to SydMontage repository providing information to be able to find/discover the location of the code. AlsoI want to give credit to Rommstar which did a lot of work and helped a lot to various people to obatin data form Digimon World.

Some emulators may need to regenerate the EDC/ECC in the bin before being able to play.

If you would like to play a hack based on this code, which also changes a lot of other features, check the Maeson hack: https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/8069/

If you only want the curling randomizer, you can download it here:

A version of the curling randomizer for the JP version of the game:

This is being done during my free time; the hack has been finished, I'm not sure if I'll upload more of the original code.
