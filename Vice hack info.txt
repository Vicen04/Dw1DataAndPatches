This patch was possible thanks to the public data provided by SydMontague's Github and the spreadsheet with extracted data. It also uses some of the data used by the randomizer made by meekrhino (The higher chances for some of the digimons).

ALL OF THE CHANGES FROM THE HACK HAVE BEEN LISTED HERE, MAKE SURE TO ALSO LOOK AT THE EXTRA PATCHES

SHORT VERSION (litte to no spoilers):

- Added Panjamon, Gigadramon and Metal etemon as evolutions to certain digimons. The requirements are the same as their normal colour counterpart (Leomon, Megadramon and Etemon).

- The three earlier mentioned digimon have different moves and types than in the original game. 

- Higher chances to find piximon, metal mamemon and mamemon in the map.

- The Monochromon shop minigame now has a lower profit requirement.

- Certain digimons now have an extra techs.

- Added an extra companion digimon.

- All of the added digimon will show in the chart.

- The electro ring and the moon mirror have been changed, now the items can be properly used to evolve to certain digimon. An item that used to be food, has been changed and now is an evolution item, another has been changed to give the same effects as the earlier item.

- Some digimon have changed the item dropped after battle.

- Factorial Town now accepts more digimon to be upgraded.

- More digimon accepted in tournaments, bettter regenaration in tournaments.

- Royal Cup restored.

- Improved lifetime extension after evolving to ultimate (from 4 days to 8 days).

- Fixed some text not rendering, changed the name and description of some items to align them better.

- A brand new mechanic which boost a specific tech for each partner digimon, it only affects your partner, NPC are not affected.

- All of the extra digimon have an evolution item that can be obtained multiple times in the game.

- The Grey Lord Mansion and the Ice Sanctuary will accept any digimon under certain conditions. This makes the game incompatible with the "unlock areas" from the randomizer.

- The bonus try has been improved (in a different way that the randomizer does it).

- Various bug fixes that improve the game.

- 3 Minor glitches added due to the changes and a bug (the bug should not trigger unless you cheat).

- The BGM will keep playing rather than resetting even if you change the map as long as the BGM on the new map is the same.

- New maps, new boss battles: be careful, since one of the maps may give visual issues to some people, it is very unlikely you enter the map by mistake. If you are worried, read the long version of this section.

- Two new finishers for two digimon.

- The Metal Banana can be obtained if Etemon feels generous (10% chance, make sure you have enough empty slots).

- The Tainted Melon is given each time you beat the Machinedramon aparition or it can be found in a certain map with a 1% chance.


14) The Grey Lord Mansion and the Ice Sanctuary will accept any digimon under certain conditions

 - As long as you have the "Mansion Key" in your inventory, any digimon will be able to enter the mansion.

 - After recruiting Angemon, any digimon will be able to enter the Ice Sanctuary


15) Bonus try improvement

  I'll do a short explanation of how the bonus try works:

  1. The game creates a random number between 1 and 9, and uses that to know if the player is lucky or not.

  2. If the value is between 5 and 8 (both included), the bonus try will attempt to help you obtain three in a row of normal images (gold poop not included). If the value is 9, it will try to help you obtain gold poops. It helps if you are short on 1 or 2 spaces to land on the same image as the row before, however, if its the row 3, it will not help if the row 1 and 2 don't match.

  3. If the player has no help, it will try to avoid 3 in a row in the last slot, with an intended 25% chance of not screwing the player (which never activates due to an error). Also, if you don't have the gold poop help, but have the normal one, it will try to avoid giving you three gold poops with also a 25% chance (which never activates due to an error) of not screwing you.
  

  - The improvement: I removed the part that tries to screw you over completely, so the help remains there. 

  - Difference with the randomizer version: The randomizer fully skips the step 2 and 3, while my patch only skips step 3.


17) New maps, new boss battles:

   - A map which can also act as a shortcut has been added to MT. Infinity. It only becomes accessible after defeating Machinedramon and the entrance will be invisible. The entrance is located at the first floor of MT. Infinity (the floor with the three annoying vermilimon), pretty close to the entrance (top right corner). 

   - BE CAREFUL, SINCE THIS MAP MAY CAUSE VISUAL RELATED ISSUES TO SOME PEOPLE: It is pretty much a rainbow mess. 
  ABOUT THE MAP: A map that only unlocks if the Back Dimension is active has been added, you can only enter that map once and before you beat the Back Dimension, if you want to enter again, you have to wait for the next Back Dimension. The entrance is located in the new map that acts as a shortcut. Three boss battles will happen here, and the battles will differ depending on the location of the Back Dimension. 5 items (one which will change depending on the back dimension) and an item box can also be found here.

   - An extra map before the Machinedramon Back Dimension battle has been added, the map and boss battle will differ depending on the Back Dimension location. If you reach 100 prosperity, these battles will change.


18) Various bug fixes:

  - Myotismon text fix: Now myotismon does explain that Greymon can evolve into SkullGraymon properly. The text after that has been changed too.

  - Gekomon missing text fix.

  - Meteoromon missing text fix.

  - Penguinmon missing text fix.

  - Monochromon joining the city missing text fix.

  - Bandits missing text fix.

  - Card vending machine missing text fix.

  - Merit points explanation missing text fix.

  - Clear Agumon Battle fix: The Clear Agumon that used to spam the same text over and over now starts a battle as intended.

  - Blue Meramon Battle fix: The Blue Meramon that used to spam the same text over and over now starts a battle as intended.

  - Improved evolution code: The evolution code for champions and rookies has been merged in a single function and now it works properly. It used to fail to calculate the latter digimon target evolutions if multiple were possible.

  - Sleep hunger error: Multiple Sunup digimon would stop eating for a day after sleeping, it could happen to other types of digimon in certain circumstances too. This has been fixed. There's a video on youtube explaining the error (not mine).

  - Sleep regeneration fix: If you slept in a place where your digimon was happy or with a rest pillow at the same time your digimon was supposed to wake up and your HP/MP was pretty high, and overflow would happens and your stats would become negative. This has been fixed. There's a video on youtube explaining the error (not mine).
   
  - Battle pass time fix: If an hour passed while in battle, the game would not add an hour to your evolution timer. If the battle makes the game go the next day, the game will not update the date neither the daily stuff given to you. This has been fixed. There's a video on youtube explaining the error (not mine).

  - Forgetting too many move after death: The game used to delete too many moves after a digimon passed by losing all its lives. This has been fixed. There's a video on youtube explaining the error (not mine).

  - MP consumption glitch fix: The text now shows correctly and it doesn't crash the game. There are multiple videos on youtube explaining the error (not mine).

  - Omni disk glitch fix: The omni disk used to ignore the limits set for a digimon, this has been fixed. There's a video on youtube explaining the error (not mine).

  - Sukamon natural evolution giving the wrong stats: The sukamon evolution was harcoded to always act as going back to the old digimon, this has been fixed mostly, there's still a way to trigger it and it would be to become a sukamon after being either an etemon or a vademon and evolving naturally to the same one again. 

  - Giromon jukebox fix: This is my version of the jukebox fix. I have changed the original code to avoid the error that happens when the text is too long. The text for the tracks in the jukebox has also been changed.  As an extra, now the jukebox shows the right name for the track Mt. Infinity (it used to be Mt. panorama).

  - Bank text glitch fix: The text for the items at the bank no longer dissapears.

  - Rotation glitch fix: Now the function for the rotation works properly, this one is different than the version from the randomizer, but it does the same.

  - Fix fresh/in-training being able to eat evo items: The fresh/in-training digimon were able to eat evolution items, the effect of course, did not trigger, so it was a way to lose an item. This has been fixed, now the digimon will reject the item.

  - Jijimon medal glitch: Jijimon would not give you a medal if your tamer level was the highest possible. This has been fixed.

  - Evolution Item flag fix: After using an evolution item, the stat gains would be disabled until you restart the game. This has been fixed.

  - The HP and MP recovery items names and descriptions have been changed to fit better the shop. 

  - The piximon dialogue glitch which made the tournament change based on the time: This was actually a bigger error which involved how dialogue choice textboxes work. Each time the player pressed "triangle" to exit this choice box, the game would jump to an unintended place of the script of the box due to missing script for the "triangle press option", this means that the game would read the wrong values and execute the wrong commands or even read bytes intended as only values as commands.
    This glitch can also trigger (with different results) when you choose between the small and big boxes in WaruMonzaemon's room and when you choose to wake up Meteoromon. Why it did not cause mayor glitches is a miracle (well, it can corrupt the game).

  - Tankmon had a wrong tech: It has in the data the tech "Fire Spit", but it is unable to use it, from looking at the data, the correct tech is "Prominence Beam". So, sometime you would see Tankmon make an animation without any sort of move coming from it. This has been fixed.

  - The Tournament Schedule now will display each tournament it the correct row.

  - The Save data file will now not display a corrupted digimon name.

  - Fixed an error where an entity trying to move can softlock if the speed is 0 in certain contidions.

  - Fixed the animations Moyjamon uses at Freezeland, it should neither lock you or go out of bounds on its own.

  - Fixed the text when you try to buy something from the Recycling shop (the glitch for infinite items/money is still there).


19) 3 Minor glitches and a bug:

  - If you obtain Panyjamon before speaking with Jijimon about the recruitment of Agumon, the game will skip that dialogue. If you recruit Agumon and speak about Jijimon about it, the game will show Panyjamon in the chart even if you never obtained it.

  - If you obtain Gigadramon before speaking with Jijimon about the recruitment of Betamon, the game will skip that dialogue. If you recruit Betamon and speak about Jijimon about it, the game will show Gigadramon in the chart even if you never obtained it.

  - If you obtain Metal Etemon before speaking with Jijimon about the recruitment of Greymon, the game will skip that dialogue. If you recruit Greymon and speak about Jijimon about it, the game will show Metal Etemon in the chart even if you never obtained it.

  BUG: Evolving Machinedramon (which can only happen with a full virus bar, Machinedramon cannot increase the virus bar anymore) will crash the game. I was planning to fix this, but at the same time is a good way to avoid the abusing of the extended lifespan that KingSukamon would give if you evolved to Sukamon. Passing away by old age has no issues.
