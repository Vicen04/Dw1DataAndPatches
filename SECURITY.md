# Security Policy

Since I have created the installer, this security policy has been added.

## Supported Versions

The latest version of the Digimon World patch installer by Vice04 found in this GitHub.
Any version downloaded from any other page will not recieve any support since is not managed by me and it has probably been uploaded without my permission.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there is a vulnerabilty, please open an issue to report it.
If there is a troublesome version in the Internet, you can also report it, but I'm not sure how much I can do about those...
